## Design

The Coffee spot has many features. alot of these features are located in the same place to make them easily accessible by the user. For example, alot of the information regarding special offers, subscriptions, menu items and general information about the page can be found right at the home page. This is all to avoid the hassle of having to go back and forth between pages in order for the user to complete a specific task. The site is minimal in its design so that it does not overstimulate the user with images and unecessary design features. The application is a tool that is meant to be used often or as frequently as the user will want the product.

### Color Scheme

The coffee spot favors brown color to remind users of coffee. The website does not focus a whole lot on images but uses different shades of brown to separate sections on the pages. The admin does have the ability to set images to the products on creation.

### Order page

Order page has a unique design choice inspired by streaming websites (oddly enough) that allows users to scroll horizontally to view products. They also have the option to search. The idea is to not display the checkout part of the page until the user has chosen their products. It is supposed to function as an all in one solution so that you don't have your store and cart separate. 

## Features

### Navbar

The Coffee Spot website has a navbar that can be accessed on every template. It allows the users to

* Access the home page by clicking the logo
* Access the subscriptions part of the home page by clicking "subscriptions"
* Access the menu part of the home page by clicking "Menu"
* Access the about part of the home page by clicking "about"
* Access the login and logout templates by clicking login or logout

The navbar also contains another link named "create product" that allows admin to access the "create product" template.

### Home Page

The first page that you are greeted with when opening the Coffee Spot is the home page. The home page consists of four sections.
* special offer
* subscriptions
* menu
* about
These sections are supposed to help the user find what they are looking for. The navbar helps navigate through these sections aswell.

At the top of the page you will find a special offer. It has some information about the one year discount on a subscription and also features a button which takes you to that specific subscription. Right below it is the subscriptions section. Here, if the special offer was not good enough, you can look at the other subscriptions and see if they are more in alignment with the product you are looking for. After the subscriptions section, you can find the menu, which is a list of all the products that are included in the menu. From here you can decide what you would like to order. And at the bottom of the page is the about section. Here you can find a text about the website and its history.

### Subscription page

By selecting one of the subscriptions on the home page by clicking "see more" you can view more details about the subscription, price information and what drinks are included in it. At the bottom of the subscription page is a form. The idea is to fill this form out to get yourself subscribed. The invoices start on the same day that you sign up. 

### Order page 

The order page features a search bar that let's you search for specific drinks to make it easier for users to find what they are looking for. If they prefer to browse, they have the horizontal scroll bar that let's you browse through the drinks.
